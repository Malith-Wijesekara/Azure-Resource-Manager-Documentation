# Access Control 

Azure Resource Manager enables you to control who has access to specific actions on your resources. It natively integrates OAuth and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into the management platform and applies that access control to all services in your resource group. 
You can add users to pre-defined platform and resource-specific roles and apply those roles to a subscription, resource group or resource to limit access. For example, you can grant a user access to a specific virtual machine in a subscription, or give a user the ability to manage all websites in a subscription but no other resources.

## Managing access to resources

Granting a user with specific permissions can be done through the preview portal or through command tools like Azure PowerShell, CLI or REST API.
