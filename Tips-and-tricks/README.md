# Tips And Tricks

** TODO - everyone pitch in here with tips/tricks :-D

## Checking the status of deployment operations
Scripts to help check on the status of deployments and find errors:
* [PowerShell](Checking-deployment-operations-PowerShell.md)
* [CLI](Checking-deployment-operations-cli.md)

## Debugging MSDeploy with Azure Web Apps 
* [Debugging MSDeploy errors with Azure Web Apps](Debugging-msdeploy-with-azure-web-apps.md)

## Inspect existing resources
* [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com) is a great tool for inspecting resources that you have created, and also for manipulating them once you are familiar with their properties. See the [walk-through](Resource-explorer.md) for more details.

## Add conditions to ARM Template
Use linked template and parameters to simulate conditional execution of templates -  [Simulating Conditional Linking](../ARM/Templates/Template_links.md#simulating-conditional-linking)
