# Tips And Tricks

** TODO - everyone pitch in here with tips/tricks :-D

## Checking the status of deployment operations
Scripts to help check on the status of deployments and find errors:
* [PowerShell](Checking-deployment-operations-PowerShell.md)
* [CLI](Checking-deployment-operations-cli.md)

## Debugging MSDeploy with Azure Web Apps 
* [Debugging MSDeploy errors with Azure Web Apps](Debugging-msdeploy-with-azure-web-apps.md)

## Inspect existing resources
* The [Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com) is a great tool for looking at resources that you've already created to understand how the resources are structured and what properties they have

** TODO - add more info on how to map this into templates, give a walkthrough with screenshots

## Add conditions to ARM Template
