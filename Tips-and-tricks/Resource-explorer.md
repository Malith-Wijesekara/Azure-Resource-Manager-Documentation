# Azure Resource Explorer
The [Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com) is a great tool for looking at resources that you've already created to understand how the resources are structured and what properties they have. The source is available on [github](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMExplorer), so also provides a reference if you need to implement similar behaviour.

** TODO - add more info on how to map this into templates, give a walkthrough with screenshots
