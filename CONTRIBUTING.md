# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by submitting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with code changes. Submissions are subject to the [repo license](LICENSE).

## General feedback and discussions?

Please start a discussion on the [repo issue tracker](https://github.com/dx-ted-emea/ARM-Documentation/issues).

## Filing issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
2. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
3. What operating system are you using?
4. What endpoints/SDK/other tools are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
