# Azure Markeplace - introduction

Content for marketplace is : 
 * [Seller dashboard](Marketplace/Seller-dashboard.md)
 * [Publish dashboard](Marketplace/Publish-dashboard.md)
 * [Single VM](Marketplace/Single-vm.md)
 * [Multi VM](Marketplace/Multi-vm.md)
 * [VM Extensions](Marketplace/VM-extensions.md)
 * [Developer services](Marketplace/Developer-services.md)
 * [Data services](Marketplace/Data-services.md)
 * [VM Depot - community managed reposity of Linux/FreeBSD images](Marketplace/VM-depot.md)

Seller and Publish dashboard sections are first because these parts should be done before any other steps, also VM Depot is quite popular option for community members or 
for non-licensing/open sourced based editions - so it's also part of extended 'marketplace'.
