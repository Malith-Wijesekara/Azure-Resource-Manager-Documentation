# Azure Markeplace - introduction

Content for marketplace is : 
 * [Seller dashboard](Seller-dashboard.md)
 * [Publish dashboard](Publish-dashboard.md)
 * [Single VM](Single-vm.md)
 * [Multi VM](Multi-vm.md)
 * [VM Extensions](VM-extensions.md)
 * [Developer services](Developer-services.md)
 * [Data services](Data-services.md)
 * [VM Depot - community managed reposity of Linux/FreeBSD images](VM-depot.md)

Seller and Publish dashboard sections are first because these parts should be done before any other steps, also VM Depot is quite popular option for community members or 
for non-licensing/open sourced based editions - so it's also part of extended 'marketplace'.
