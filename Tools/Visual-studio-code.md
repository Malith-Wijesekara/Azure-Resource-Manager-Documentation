# Tools for ARM - Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a free, cross-platform editor, and has built-in support for JSON schema, so will provide a reasonable ARM Template editing experience out-of-the-box. 


To get a richer experience for editing ARM templates in Visual Studio Code, install the [Azure Resource Manager Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) extension. This extension adds features such as IntelliSense of function names, variables, and parameters.
